LEARN TO CODE:

If you don't know HTML or CSS you should watch a short video about it first! :)

You should learn javascript before learning react I highly recomend this video tutorial by the amazing Derek Banans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fju9ii8YsGs

Or you could read online tutorials, for example this one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/doceb/JavaScript/Guide

Resources for learning react: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html And a lot of googling :) We should also learn redux.

Resources for learning django:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/
and looking at examples etc...
